I have created 4 predicates.
Instructions:
1.The dutch_flag_sort takes 2 arguments ,it is assumed that First argument is a List.
2.It is already given that the list contains atoms,as they are surrounded by single quotes.
3.So, the output only has atoms (not surrounded by single quotes, in prolog 'atom'=atom).
4.The list should only have 'red' or 'white' or 'blue' as its elements and any other elements are not allowed.
 Any other input will give false and a message would be printed.
5.There are other helper predicates added to count number of instances and appending to the list when needed.
6.It is a linear algorithm as only O(n) (n is length of list) is used.
7.After the output is printed, you must only press enter, to abort the current query( This might not be required sometimes).

To run :-
1.consult('210101069_Lab7.pl').
2.dutch_flag_sort(['white', 'red', 'blue', 'red', 'white', 'blue'], Sorted).
3.dutch_flag_sort(['red', 'blue', 'red', 'white', 'blue'], Sorted).
4.dutch_flag_sort(['red', 'blue', 'red', 'white', 'green'], Sorted).
5.dutch_flag_sort(['red', 'blue', 'red', 'white','red','red'], Sorted).
6.dutch_flag_sort([], Sorted).
7.dutch_flag_sort(['blue','blue','red'],Sorted).
