-- Instructions
1.The enetered elements must be integers separated by spaces
2.The function takes list of integers as input and generates list of lists
3.This chooses first element as it iterates through list of integers and rest of the elements are given by recursive call(this recursive call takes argument list of integers without first chosen element).
4.Delete,allIntegers,nubLists are helper functions.
5.Empty list will give only list containing empty list.
6.If equal elements are present then equal lists could be generated, these are removed, by checking for duplicates.
